# SPELLING BEE GAME
This is a clone of the game on the New York Times Game page. Available on GitHub pages [here](https://jytrowbridge.github.io/spelling-bee-webapp/).

## About
I was inspired by the New York Times game, found [here](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee).
The game is written in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I used the 2019 Collins Scrabble Word Dictionary to check for word validity. I thought this would be more restrictive than a normal dictionary, but the opposite was true. Some of the words in it are truly ridiculous.

## How to Play
Find as many words as you can using the letters in the hexes. Words must obey the following rules:
- The center letter must be used at least once. 
- The other letters can be used any number of times.
- Words must be at least 4 letters long.

## Features
- Each game uses random letters, but the combination of letters must have at least 20 possible words
- Keyboard functionality
- Game saving via cookies
- Mobile compatible
